# Technologies
  I have created this project using react js front end liabrary
  
# Approach
- This project consists of reusable components such as Home , MediaBody and Information components.
- The Home component is used to show the data received from the API calls.
- The state "data" which is initially empty receives the required information from the API calls.
- Then the information is displayed on the homescreen.
- The Mediabody component is used to show individual data elements .
- The Information comoponent is used for detail information of a particular experiment of spacex which gets triggered after a button click
- I have used axios for API calls and react bootstrap for responsive design.
- Different filters like successful landings,successfull launches and experiments on a particular year can be obtained from the top navbar.
- Every experiment is wrapped inside a container and displayed on the screens.
  


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
